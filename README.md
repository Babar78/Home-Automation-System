# Home-Automation-System
 
 This is our End Semester IOT project in which we have designed a home automation system which can be used in different homes and home societies. It has a Arduino MicroController as the base of the whole project with all the info being passed through it. We have ThingSpeak as an online source to visualize the whole data from the sensors.
